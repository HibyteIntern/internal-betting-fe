# InternalBettingFe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

## Running the development server

You can start the local development server and access the served resources on `http://localhost:4200` by running the command `npm start`

## Before making a pull request

Make sure that you run a `npm run lint` (in case you don't already have an ESLint extension installed in your IDE) and fix all the errors that show up. After that, you should run a `npm run prettier:fix` (again, if you haven't already set up a plugin that does this automatically).
